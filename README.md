	abstract = {Autism and schizophrenia share some genotipic and phenotypic aspects as connectome miswiring and common cognitive deficits. Current diagnostics for both disorders include direct reports of relatives and clinical evaluation by a psychiatrist. Several medical imaging biomarkers have been proposed in the past. This work proposes a dynamical functional connectome analysis combined with machine learning techniques to complement the present diagnostic procedure. We used sliding window technique to locate a set of dynamic functional connectivity states and then use them as features to classify subjects as autism/schizophrenia or control. Moreover, by using dynamic functional connectivity measures we investigate the question whether those two disorders overlaps, namely whether the schizophrenia is part of the autism spectrum. The results reveals that both static and dynamic functional connectivity can be used to classify subjects with schizophrenia or autism. Lastly, some brain regions show similar functional flexibility in both autism and schizophrenia cohorts giving further proofs of overlaps.},
